Integrated MPI & OpenMP modifications to NASA’s General Mission Analysis Tool. 
Achieved 2,387% speedup on 62x Monte-Carlo simulation trials distributed across 36x 2-core nodes, 
compared to sequential runtime.


Designed a dynamic quantum circuit generator using CUDA-Q which can find factors of large 
semiprimes using asymptotically lesser qubits than existing methods.
Ran simulations with Slurm using a custom Singularity container on the SDSC 
Expanse supercomputer.


Wrote a distributed prime number sieve in C which uses MPI to divide the search 
region evenly across all nodes. OpenMP is used to parallelize the local filtering 
through each node’s region. The prime sieve itself is stored as a binary mapping 
to maximize memory efficiency. Tests were run using Slurm with provided 
Singularity containers on SDSC Expanse. I achieved 13,482% speedup (99.3% parallel)
compared to the sequential runtime searching for all primes below 10 billion.



Designed and implemented the relay server, cross-NAT P2P, physics, engine, and 
website for a 2-player arcade-style fighting game with cross-platform support, 
using only standard library functions for everything besides the GUI, which 
uses SDL3. Cross-platform support for Windows and UNIX systems. CMake was used 
for build automation and generation of installation wizard. Website and relay 
server both hosted on Google Compute Engine (GCE) VMs.


Simulated an iterative adaptation of the prisoner’s dilemma on a variety of 
networks. Automated generation of animations visualizing model statistics.


Constructed a conversion & processing pipeline for extracting road networks 
from Open Street Map (OSM) data. Prioritized memory efficiency by parsing file 
streams to generate a network with less unnecessary overhead. 



Led research efforts to design Quantum Computing algorithms, to be compared 
against equivalent parallel solutions. Quantum circuits implemented with 
CUDA-Q in C++.
